The most controversial of the weapons of the Ryukyu but in essence the least properly explored. There are three types of this weapon taught in the Ryukyu Kobujutsu syllabus, the 2 section, 3 section and the 4 section. Made preferably of red or white oak, or a heavy wood, the sections are tapered from the chord end (2.5cm) to the predominant strike end (3.3cm). 

The shafts vary from octagonal to round in shape and the weight is dependent on the strength of the user. Again too light and there is no power, and too heavy and the movement is slow and ponderous. Traditionally this weapon is not used in pairs, as the actions of the one should be sufficient. The grips are similar to that of the Sai in name, Honte-Mochi” (Natural), “Gyakute-Mochi”(Reverse) and Tokushu- Mochi”(Special grip). The special grip falls into “Ippon-Tsuki”(single thrust) and “Tatami-Tsuki” (folding thrust). Nunchaku belongs to the family of Bo and is known as the “portable Bo”.



History has not endowed this weapon with traditional kata as shown by the content of those handed down. They are by design training kata to enable better handling and combination work. The essence of the weapon is the kumite, exploring distance, angles and footwork. Impact should be on the tip of the weapon or it will bounce back on the user. Whilst it is noted that there is a farming implement of the Nunchaku design, it should be pointed out that again China was using this weapon concept long before it was recorded as a Ryukyu weapon.
