History :

Developed in the 17th century by Okinawans after the Japanese gained occupation of their land, the nunchaku was one of many harmless looking farm tools used as weapons for self defense. The nunchaku were made of two hardwood sticks held together by a rope or chain. Originally the rope was made of braided horse hair.

Traditional Use :

The nunchaku was an agricultural tool used for threshing grain, wheat and rice. As a weapon the nunchaku was used in conjunction with various stances, strikes and blocking techniques. Strikes were made over hand, under hand, from the left and right side often incorperating a figure eight motion. A good martial artist would be equally skillful with his left and right hand. The sticks could be used for spearing, striking and blocking. The rope or chain could choke, block or trap.

Current Use :

The nunchaku is a popular weapon for demonstrations. It is also used as a weapon for self defense for karate stylists and law enforcement agencies.

			<b>History of a Village nation</b><br>

The RyuKyu Islands have been inhabited for at least 2,000 years and by virtue of their strategic location have been occupied by both the Chinese and the Japanese throughout the ages. One of the earliest encounters with the Chinese was in the Sui dynasty (AD 581-618), when an expedition attempted to subjugate the islanders, who were mainly farmers and fishermen. The Japanese became aware of the islands existence around the year 600 and by 700 had brought certain RyuKyu clans within their allegiance. In the course of time customs and beliefs from both China and Japan influenced the cultural growth of RyuKyu inhabitants.
          During the thirteenth century Okinawa ruled by Shunten and other successive kings after him. This main island centred around village life. Each community was headed by an aji (from the verb arugji, master), who was like a chieftain, and each village community was very close knit with its own ways and customs. By the fourteenth century Okinawa was divided into three kingdoms called Chuzan, Hokuzan and Nanzan. Towards the end of the century, travellers from the Chinese province of Fukien began to settle in the area of Naha and, apart from trade links, Chinese culture again began to affect both buildings and customs alike. Although the chuzan state instigated the chinese relationship, the other two demains continued to seek Chinese recognition  and favours. The power of the Chuzan state grew, Naha became the main trading port of the island and shuri the seat of government. Eventually the Chuzan provice became responsible for the complete control of Okinawa.
          In the reign of king Sho Shin, which began in 1478, various edicts were passed. The most significant to the martial arts scholar was that which prohibited the possession or use of arms by private citizens. All implements of warfare were collected and stored in a government warehouse at Shuri. As a result of the enforcement of these edicts, not only did empty-hand fighting styles grow, but the lower classes developed fighting techniques adapting ordinary household implements and usign home-made weapons that appeared to be everyday working tools.

		<b>Nunchaku -- The traditional Flail</b><br>
		There are several possible theories regarding the origin of nunchaku. One is that it may have derived from an instrument used for crushing beans. A second theory is that it was adapted from the instrument carried by the village night watch, which is made of two blocks of wood joined by cord. The night watch would hit the blocks of wood together to attract people's attention and then warn them about fires and protect there property. It is probable that heavy-duty weapons were made and hung with other similar farming instruments, so that they were not detected. The nunchaku may or may not have been joined by a chain, but it is unlikely as the RyuKyu (Okinawa) Islands had no source of iron ore and most metals were imported. Cord was the most likely way in which they were secured together. Another theorie that I've heard myself. is that the nunchaku was used by farmers for plowing rice fields.
    Unlike the exotic flailing actions portrayed in martial arts movies, the exponent of nunchaku was very conservative in his movements. No true exponent would spin the nunchaku under his legs or around his neck while his enemy was attempting to kill him. The skill was in effective blocks and instant, accurate strikes at the enemy. If the flail hit a target then it would bounce back and had to be brought within the user's control quickly. Like okinawate, nunchaku power was developed through repetition of Kata, which developed a powerful and accurate strike. These techniques complemented the empty-hand styles.

Nunchaku as a weapon comes originally from Okinawa (Ryukyu) - archipelago which is part of today's Japan. In 1429, King Sho Hashi united the three parts of Okinawa, creating the Ryukyu Kingdom. To decrease the possibility of a revolt, he declared prohibition to carry weapons (kin bu) - none but the king's army and nobles can carry weapons. Of course, usual people became helpless against the swords of soldiers and bandits (wako). To defend themselves, okinawan citizens and villagers widely practised Martial arts. In the beginning of XVII century Okinawa was occupied by Japan, the Okinawan army was defeated and unarmed population was unable to resist to Japanese samurais. Okinawa was turned into a Japanese protectorate, the population had to pay high taxes and was discriminated in other ways. Inhabitants didn't begin serious revolts, but killed Japanese officials and tax collectors here and there, attacked small groups of samurais. Then there were created secret groups who fought against Japanese soldiers. Then warlords prohibited carrying and owning of any kind of weapon, everyone who owned weapons had to be killed according to new law. There was organised the so-called "hunting of swords" (katana-giri) - all iron weapons (and even iron tools) were confiscated, forges were closed. In these bad days only one knife for a complete village was allowed - this knife was stored on the square of village tied to pillar and villagers were allowed to take this knife only for a few hours and only after confirmation of the village leader. In this period okinawan martial arts were widely spread as last possible means of self-defence. Of course, knowledge of unarmed fighting techniques can't help on battlefield against regular army, but sometimes it was enough to defend against a few bandits. Citizens mainly practised unarmed arts of to-te or okinawa-te, which later became the basics for today's karate, villagers usually trained in the use of everyday's tools as weapons, today we know these systems as kobudo or kobujutsu.
In the hands of a kobudo practitioner usual tools were converted to weapons when needed - not such lethal weapons, as sword or spear, but serious enough to really increase chances to defeat opponents. In the list of most popular tools, which were learned in kobudo as weapons, were such things as staff (bo or rokushakubo), baton (hanbo), sickle (kama), handle of home millstone (tonfa) and, of course, nunchaku. Popular myth say, that nunchaku were used in original as flail, but it's a mistake - okinawan flail, like European, have human-height length handle, such tools are also used as a kobudo weapon. Nunchaku was originally used as a horse bit. Original nunchaku sticks were curved and became only later the model which is used today - with straight handles. The nunchaku wasn't a very popular weapon - we can see this because none traditional nunchaku kata is known today (for comparison - more then a dozen traditional staff katas are known today). The low popularity of nunchaku came probably from its low effectiveness when used against sword or staff - in such situation tonfa or kama give more chances to defeat the opponent. But one who was skilled in nunchaku usage was able to easily defeat a few opponents, who were unarmed or armed by knives. So today, when swords and spears are passed to museums, nunchaku has become one of the most popular weapons.
