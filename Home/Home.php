			<h2>NFN xi hen how!</h2>
			Learning is definitely not mere imitation, nor is it the ability to accumulate and regurgitate fixed knowledge. Learning is a constant process of discovery, a process without end. In Ngau Fu Nunchaku we begin not by accumulation but by discovering the cause of our ignorance, a discovery that involves a shedding process.<br>

			Unlike a "classical" martial art, there is no series of rules or classification of technique that constitutes a distinct "Ngau Fu Nunchaku" method of fighting. Ngau Fu Nunchaku is not a form of special conditioning with its own rigid philosophy. It looks at combat not from a single angle, but from all possible angles. While Ngau Fu Nunchaku utilizes all the ways and means to serve its end (after all, efficiency is anything that scores), it is bound by none and is therefore free. In other words, Ngau Fu Nunchaku possesses everything, but is in itself possessed by nothing.<br>
			<br>
			The best techniques are the simple ones done correctly, and in NFN, it is not how much you have learned, but how much you have absorbed in what you have learned.<br>
