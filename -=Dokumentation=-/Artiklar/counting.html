</center><font face="arial" size="3">
<pre>
1	Ichi ("itch")

3	San ("saan")
4	Shi ("she") - *Yon ("yawn")*
5	Go ("go")
6	Roku ("rue - k")
7	Shichi ("she -ch") - *Nana ("naa-naa")*
8	Hachi ("hach")
9	Ku ("coo")
10	Ju ("joo")

Numbers past 10

11	Juichi ("joo-itch") - It is simply "10 - 1"
12	Juni ("joo-knee")
and so on....

20	Niju ("knee-joo") - It is simply "2 - 10"
21	Nijuichi ("knee-joo-itch") "2 - 10 - 1"
and so on....

30	Sanju ("saan-joo")
40	Yonju ("yawn-joo")

100	Hyaku ("he-ya-koo")
101	Hyaku-ichi ("he-ya-koo-itch")

200	Ni-hyaku ("knee-he-ya-koo")
201	Ni-hyaku-itch ("knee-he-ya-koo-itch")
*600*	Roppyaku ("row-pya-koo")
*800*	Happyaku ("ha-pya-koo")

1000	Sen ("sen") - The "s" sounds like a "z" when it comes after an "n".  
	See the example below.
1001	Sen-itch ("sen-itch")
*8000*	Hassen ("ha-sen")
10,000      Man ("maan")
100,000    Ju-man ("joo-maan") - This is literally "ten ten-thousands"
1,000,000 Hyaku-man ("he-ya-koo-maan")

Just keep adding the numbers together
Examples:	3458 = San-zen-yon-hyaku-go-ju-hachi
		8639 = Hassen-roku-hyaku-san-ju-ku
		43,784 = Yon-man-nana-hyaku-hachi-ju-shi

	The story of 4 and 7<br><br>
Many of the Japanese characters are "borrowed" from the Chinese.  There is a unique Japanese<br> 
language but the Chinese characters are what are more commonly used.<br>
"Shi" is the Chinese symbol for "four" (note: even though it's the same written character,<br> 
the Chinese and Japanese pronounce them differently) but is also the Japanese character for "death".<br> 
The Japanese feel uncomfortable using the same character for their numbers and for death - so it <br>
is common practice to use the native Japanese characters for 4 and for 7 (the first half of seven is <br>
"shi").<br>
Past counting to ten, it is considered proper form to use the Japanese characters instead of the <br>
Chinese when using 4 or 7.  You can use "shi" or "shichi" for the one's digit - but not for the <br>
other digits.<br>
Example:  	17 = Jushichi but 70 = Nanaju.<br>
		40 = Yonju - but 44 = Yonjushi<br>
