Forms, Taolu, and Kata in general

    Many beginning and even advanced martial artists make the mistake of underestimating the importance of forms training. They view forms as something they are simply forced to learn in order to advance in rank. This is a huge mistake for any martial artist to make. In a good system, forms improve a student's strength, flexibility, balance, technique, and mental focus. In addition to this, a good form will teach a student several different combinations or particular strategy to use in a conflict. The dislike that many students develop for forms is due simply to their inneffective use of this training technique.

     When practicing a new form, work slowly. Focus first on correctly executing each technique. Watch your balance and footwork as you work your way through it. Do not focus on power, speed, or kicking height yet. As you become more familiar with the form, begin to make each technique flow seemlessly into the next. This is not to be confused with speed. Keep it smooth and together. Then, only when you know that form without thinking about it, should you begin to work on speed and power. Now is the time that you should break it back down into it's component movements and develop explosive force and accuracy in each strike. Also focus on the speed and efficiency of each defense. End each form practice session with a smooth, focused run-through of the form. Never end your practice having worked on power and individual technique.

     When practicing a familiar form it is also important to visualize it as a conflict or series of conflicts. In your mind's eye, you should see you attacker coming at you. Defeat the attacker with the combinations and defenses presented in the form. This way, the form will also serve as a kind of positive imagery meditation. It will allow your mind to grow accustomed to using the combinations presented in the form against an attacker. Above all else, don't ignore your forms training.
